# Password  based security door lock system using Arduino     
## Problem Statement
As thefts are increasing day by day, security becomes the major issue for everyone. In the recent times, security has become a serious threat and people are opting for more secured resources. Many cases have been registered due to burglary at homes.

## Proposed Solution
So, we decided to design an Arduino based system aiming to secure our locks. This system allows only authorized person to access the house by door-latch opening using a PIN entered through keypad.

## Hardware Used
- Arduino UNO
- LCD display (16Ã—2)
- Servo motor
- Breadboard
- Buzzer 
- 12V Adapter

## Software Technologies Used
- Arduino IDE
- TinkerCAD
- VS code studio

## Circuit Diagram



##  Overview of Project



## How it works?



## Features
- The main advantage of the Electronic Door Locks is high resistance to cracking. For example, with a password of only four characters, we get 10,000 possible combinations. And adding one more digit gives 100,000 options.
- The security level can be increased by adding a biometric fingerprint scanner. so entry will be allowed for the authorized person using their fingerprints. 
- Also the lock could be opened by sending password as a SMS to GSM module by the owner.
- We can also interface cameras to the Arduino so that it could capture the picture of the thief who is trying to breach the security. We can send this data to a remote location using mobile or internet.
